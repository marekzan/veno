# Veno

**VE**rsion **NO**tifier

If you need to regularly track and update your 3rd-party artifacts, Veno might be just what you need. With Veno, you can define artifacts and attach multiple notifiers to them. Veno will notify you whenever new versions of your artifacts are available.

## Description

So, what are **artifacts** and **notifiers**?

### Artifacts

An artifact is any (GitHub) repository that uses tags to assign versions to its releases. You can define an artifact like this:

```json
{
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "name": "Rust",
      "message_prefix": "There is a new version of:", // optional
      "current_version": "1.83.0",
      "source": {
        "type": "github",
        "repo": "rust-lang/rust"
      },
      "notifier": ["team_slack"]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Source

A source specifies where Veno should look for new versions. Currently, we support the following sources:

- **GitHub**

### Notifiers

A notifier specifies where notifications should be sent. Currently, we support the following sinks:

- **Email**
- **Google Chat**
- **Slack**

Additional sinks, such as Microsoft Teams and Rocket Chat, are planned.

Here’s an example of a notifier configuration:

```json
{
  "notifiers": [
    {
      "name": "team_slack",
      "sink": {
        "type": "slack",
        "webhook": "..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Supported Sink Configurations

- **Slack**:

  ```json
  {
    "sink": {
      "type": "slack",
      "webhook": "..."
    }
  }
  ```

- **Google Chat**:

  ```json
  {
    "sink": {
      "type": "google_chat",
      "webhook": "..."
    }
  }
  ```

- **Email**:
  ```json
  {
    "sink": {
      "type": "email",
      "host": "smtp...",
      "port": 587,
      "username": "...",
      "password": "..."
    }
  }
  ```

## Usage

Veno can be operated in two modes:

1. **CLI**  
   The CLI mode executes a single operation each time it is run.

2. **Web Service**  
   The web service uses Axum to provide endpoints for triggering checks, retrieving version lists, and other useful actions in the future.

### Configuration

Both operation modes require a `config.json` file, which must be passed using the `--config` parameter. An example configuration file is included in the `example` folder.

Here's a sample `config.json`:

```json
{
  "artifacts": [
    {
      "name": "Rust",
      "message_prefix": "There is a new version of:", // optional
      "source": {
        "type": "github",
        "repo": "rust-lang/rust"
      },
      "current_version": "1.83.0",
      "notifier": ["team_slack", "private_email"]
    }
  ],
  "notifiers": [
    {
      "name": "team_slack",
      "sink": {
        "type": "slack",
        "webhook": "..."
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "private_email",
      "sink": {
        "type": "email",
        "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
        "port": 587,
        "username": "username",
        "password": "password"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "team_google_chat",
      "sink": {
        "type": "google_chat",
        "webhook": "..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Roadmap

### What’s Working:

- **Modes**: CLI
- **Sources**: GitHub
- **Sinks**: Slack, Google Chat

### In Progress:

- Refactoring the codebase
- Email as a sink

### Planned Features:

- Allow environment variables in the configuration file (e.g., `${password}`) for sensitive data
- More sources: GitLab, Bitbucket, Docker Hub, Artifacthub, etc.
- Additional sinks: Microsoft Teams, Rocket Chat, etc.
- Scheduling for periodic checks
- update the current_version field in the configuration file automatically
- Web endpoint to silence notifications for a specific artifact
- make notifiers have references to artifacts so that only one message is being sent to the sink for multiple artifacts
- include alpha, beta, and release candidate versions and allow users to specify which versions to track
- decide on which version update you want to be notified (major, minor, patch...)
- yaml config support
- custom Chat Cards for Sinks (if supported)
- and many more
