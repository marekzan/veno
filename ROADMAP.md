| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | make notifiers have references to artifacts so that only one message is being sent to the sink for multiple artifacts     |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | yaml config support                                                                                                       |

| ðŸ”œ Planned | implement a config linter (check if notifiers, sources and references are valid)                                          |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | Web endpoint to silence notifications for a specific artifact                                                             |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | update the current_version field in the configuration file automatically                                                  |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | decide on which version update you want to be notified (major, minor, patch or other version regex)                       |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | include alpha, beta, and release candidate versions and allow users to specify which version to track                     |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | scheduling for periodic checks (daemon mode)                                                                              |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | custom Chat Cards for Sinks (if supported)                                                                                |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | alpha, beta, and release candidate versions                                                                               |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | give Veno a repo address where the config file is located. this allows veno to pull and update the config file.           |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | multiple config files for different teams (including repos with config files)                                             |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | script file template to run commands for veno which runs in a k8s pod                                                     |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | Be able to split artifact and notifier definitions and merge them. So that different teams can maintain their own configs |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | Make the version logic more robust (own crate; schema detection; schema logic, etc.)                                      |
| ðŸ”œ Planned | Option to also notify with the changelog or just the link to the changelog                                                |
